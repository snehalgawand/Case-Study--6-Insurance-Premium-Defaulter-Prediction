# Case-Study--6-Insurance-Premium-Defaulter-Prediction

Premium paid by the customer is the major revenue source for insurance companies. Default in premium payments results in significant revenue losses and hence insurance companies would like to know upfront which type of customers would default premium payments. 
The objective of this project is to predict the probability that a customer will default the premium payment, so that the insurance agent can proactively reach out to the policy holder to follow up for the payment of premium.
